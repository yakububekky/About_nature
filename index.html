            Natural cycles for life
    If a city’s supply of fresh air and water were
    cut and its sewers blocked, disease and death
    would soon follow. But consider: Our planet is
    not like a restaurant, where new food and supplies
    are shipped in from outside and garbage is carted
    away. The clean air and water we depend on are
    not shipped in from outer space, nor is waste matter rocketed out. So how does the earth remain
    healthy and habitable? The answer: the natural cycles, such as water, carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen
    cycles, explained here and shown simplified.

                <p class="text"> Water is essential to life.
                    None of us can live without it for more than
                    a few days. The water cycle distributes fresh,
                    clean water around the planet. It involves
                    three stages. (1) Solar power lifts water into
                    the atmosphere by evaporation. (2) Condensation of this purified water produces clouds.
                    (3) Clouds, in turn, form rain, hail, sleet, or
                    snow, which falls to the ground, ready to evaporate again, thus completing the cycle. How much
                    water is recycled annually? According to estimates, enough to cover the earth’s surface uniformly to a depth of more than two and a half feet.</p>

                <p class="text"> As you know,
                    in order to live you need to breathe, to take in

                    the same thing, why does our atmosphere never
                    run out of oxygen and become overloaded with
                    carbon dioxide? The answer lies in the oxygen
                    cycle. (1) In an amazing process called photosynthesis, plants take in the carbon dioxide that
                    we exhale, using it and the energy from sunlight
                    to produce carbohydrates and oxygen. (2) When

        <p class="text ">
            Everything humans have need to survive, and thrive, was provided by the natural world around us : Food , water, medicine, material for shelter and even natural cycles such as climate and nutrient scientist have come to term such gift "Ecosystem service."
        </p>
        <li class="text2">Yet we have disconnected ourselves from the natural world that is easy and often convenient, to forget that nature remains as given as ever as ever, even as it vanishes bit-by-bit.</li>
        <li class=" text2">Th rise of new technologies and industry may have distance us superficially from nature, but it has not change our reliance on natural world; most of what we use and condume on a daily basis remains the product of multitude of interactions within  nature ,and many of those interaction are impriled.
        <li class="text2">Beyond such physical goods the natural world provide less tangible,but just as important gifts in terms of beauty, art and spirituality.</li>

    <h3 class="tertiary-heading r-th">Evidence of the Creator </h3>
    <p class="text2 ">TAKE the most powerful telescope, and look into the immensity of the heavens. Peer through a modern microscope into the amazing intricacy of molecules and atoms. And what do we see? This-that in the stupendously, large as well as in the minutely small, yes, in all the physical universe-there is order,beauty and design.And where we see design, what do we conclude? Dose not the Bible indicate the answer,at <span class="diff2 ">Hebrews 3vs4</span>? "Of course, every house is construsted by someone, but he that construted all things is God." </p>   
    <p class="text2">And what about order? It was the God-fearing scientist sir Isaac Newton who first noted that things in the universe were moving from order to disdorder. This led to the conclusion that, unless there is purposeful intervention by some outside force, every physical transformation in the world about us must be accompanied by a loss design. The original design is breaking down. In the first place,then, someone must have designed, created and put things in order. Without that deigner's intervention, order will keep on breaking down.
        <br>That intelligent Designer brought forth that the universe is in harmony with what some scientist called the <b>big-bang theory of creation.</b> In receny years this theory has gained ascendacy over the "steady-state" theory, which claims that the universe is without beginning, But we do not have to rely on shifting sands of modern scientific theory to prove that there is a creator. For the creator himself makes clear who and what he is: "This is what Jehovah has said,....'I myself have made the earth and have created even man upon it.I-my own hands have stretched out the heavens, and all the army of them i have commanded." <span class="diff2 "> Isaiah 45 vs 11-12.</span>
        <br>The evidence of his creationship is to be marvel at in so many things that we see around us.
    </p>
    <h3 class="tertiary-heading ">"I... Have Created Even Man"</h3>
    <p class="text">
        After he made the earth, Jehovah created life on it, First he filled the earth with plants and animals. Then, <b>"God went on to creat Man in his own image." </b>
        No doubt, at some time or another, we have all fondled the tiny fingers of an infant-so delicate, so beautiful formed, so precous-so much more refined than animals claws! And no doubt we have reflected on how that baby's small life got started from a mother's egg the size of a pin point, by union with a father's sperm far too small to be seen by the unaided eye. Yes, we all had a tiny beginning, in an egg cell that divided and divided, and kept on dividing, till finally the more than 10,000,000,000,000 cells that make up the adult human "knew" when to leave off dividing. 
        <br>
        What makes humans unique? Since we can reflect his qualities, such as love, justice. He also created us with the ability to learn languages, appreciates art, and enjoy music. And unlike any animals, we can worship our creator

    <p class="text">The entire process of conception and selective growth is marvelous behond our comprehention. But it is not behond the comprehention of God, For he is the Authur. As king david said: "My bones were not hidden from you when i was made in secret...Your eyes saw even the embryo of me, and in your book all its part were down in writing." Yes it is according to "blueprint" made  by my loving creator that we were formed, given a marvelous body and endowed with moral attributes abd qualities designed to keep our lives in balance and to keep a constant delight. So we have every reason to join David in the melodious words uttered 3,000 years ago: "O Jehovah, you have searched through me ....You kept me screen off in the belly of my mother. I shall praise you because in a fear-inspiring way i am wonderfully made. your works are wonderfully as my soul is very well aware. "

<p class="text2"><b>T</b>here is no end to the wonders built into God's creation, man, How can some calim that life started by blind chances, and that man elvolved from series of accident? In the infinitesimal huan cell there are ladderlike DNA moleccoles, each programmed for that particular individual, the same messages of life being written in each multiplying cell. These tell which cells must go to mae up the eyes, the skin, the nose,the nose, the tongue, the ears, the teeth, the skin, the organs and all other body parts. They make sure the "kind" is distinctly human, not ape or dog or any other lower animal. They spell out the inheritable characteristics of the individul. The specialise part that came out of this growth process do indeed bespeak a brillant Designer!!</p>

<h3 class="tertiary-heading">The Grand-Designer</h3>
<p class="text">
 picture a father talking with his seven-years-old son. He says, "long ago, God made the earth and everything in it, and he made the sun the moon, and the stars." The boy thinks about this for a few moment and then asks, "Daddy, who made God?"<br>
 "  Nobody made God,"He has always existed." That simple statement stistfy the child for now. As he grows older, however the questiion continues to intrigue  him. He finds it hard to comprehend how anyone could be without a beginning. Why, even the universe had a beginning. 'Where did God come from?' he wonders.
</p>
<p class="text2">
    How does the Bible answer? Essentially, in much the same way as did the father in our example.<br> Moses wrote: "Oh Jehovah,...before the mountains were born or you brought forth the earth and the productive land, <b><e>From everlasting to everlasting,</e></b> you are God." ( psalm 90 vs 1, 2). Likewise, the prophet Isaiah exlaimed: "Do you not know? Have you not heard? Jehovah, the creator of the end of the earth, <b><e>is a God for all enternity"!</e></b> (Isaiah 40:28)Similarly, the letter of jude refer to God as existing "for all past enternity.-Jude 25." <br>
    The scriptures shows us that God is the "king of enternity", as the apostle pual describes him. (1Timothy 1vs 7) This means that God has always existed, no matter how far back in time we cast our gaze. And he will always exist in the future. (Revelation 1 vs 8) Thus, his enternal existence is a fundermental attribute of the almighty.
    <div class="text2">
        Why do we find this idea difficult to grasp? Because our limited our life span gives us a completely different consept of time from Jehovah. Because God is enternal, to Him a thousand years are like a day. ( 2 peter 3vs 8) To illustrate: Could a grasshopper, which lives as an adult for only about 50 days, fathom our life span of 70 or 80 years? Hardly! yet, the Bible explains thatwe areblike grasshopper in comparison with our Grand creator. Even our ability to reason is dwarfted by his.( Isaiah40:22, 55,:8 vs 9) So it is not surprising that there are aspect of Jehovah's nature that escape full human understading.
        <br>
        Although the Concept of an external God has be hard to grasp, we can see that it makes sense. If someone else had created God, that person would be the creator. Yet, as the Bible explain, Jehovahis the one who craeted all things." ( Revelation 4: 11) Furthermore, we know that the universe at one time did not exist first. Hebalso existed before there were anyother intelligent beings, such as his only-begotten Son and the angels. (job 38:4,7 colossians 1:15) Clearly, then, he existed alone first; He could not have been created; nothing was in existence that could have created him.
